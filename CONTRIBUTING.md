## How to contribute to LIST-websites-reference

I'm so glad to meet you in this project. I need new people who are interested in archiving useful websites together or making something new with the archived websites list.

If you don't have any, still I think you can find any typos or suggestions about this project.

Any willing to participate into this project is always welcome.

<br />

### üòÑ. Do you have any website(s) list to contribute?

Then you can fork this repository and make any new branch(e.g. `develop`) you want.

Add website list in appropriate category using `+` to make dot sign in `README.md` and `README-ENG.md`.

```md
## Appropriate category

sub-category
+ https://anyUsefulWebsites.abcde/
```

If there is no appropriate category or sub-category, then you also can make it. But when you want to make new category(not sub-category), don't forget to bring a change to table of contents. If you make 'new category', you can make new content in table of contents like below.

```md
# Table of Contents

[New category](#New-category)
```

Then open parenthesis to describe the website. You should use language badge and give a description. There are 4 language badges that you can use below.

```md
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/ENG-F7DF1E?style=flat-square"/>
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/KOR-CD2E3A?style=flat-square"/>
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/ESP-E3730E?style=flat-square"/>
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/JPN-E6D0E4?style=flat-square"/>
```

Until now, only websites written in English, Korean, Japanese and Spanish can be merged, because I'm the one who manage this project now.

Right after the badge, write a simple description about website. You can use title of the post if it describes contents well, or you can make your own description about it.

```md
## Appropriate category

sub-category
+ https://anyUsefulWebsites.abcde/ ( <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/ESP-E3730E?style=flat-square"/> Appropriate description)
```

Don't forget to add same website to both `README.md` and `README-ENG.md`. In `README-ENG.md`, use English when you describe it. In `README.md`, you can use both Korean and English. If you have any language that you can't speak, make PR and write about your work.

#### üßÆ commit message convention

There is no existent convention about commit message. It will be made sooner rather than later.

<br />

### üòÑ. Do you feel any website(s) in the list is(are) no more valid?

Then remove it(them) from the list and make PR with detailed reasons why each website is no more valid.

e.g. No more valid url, Not matched to described contents, Different language(not match any of 4 languages), etc.

<br />

### üìã. Do you have any proposal or report(bug, etc.) to this project?

goto [issue page](https://github.com/PajaritoMoyqi/LIST-websites-reference/issues) and click 'New issue' and select 'Proposal' or 'Report' to get appropriate issue template. Sometimes we're gonna make a new discussion if it's needed.

If we decide to follow your proposal/report or make something new based on your proposal/report, and you have willing to participate in, you can.

After making it or fix it, you can make PR with a given template. Please don't forget to link opened related issue.

<br />

### ‚ùì. Do you have any question to this project?

goto [issue page](https://github.com/PajaritoMoyqi/LIST-websites-reference/issues) and click 'New issue' and select 'Question' to get appropriate issue template.

<br />

### ‚åõ. Do you want to know whether there are pending works or not?

goto [issue page](https://github.com/PajaritoMoyqi/LIST-websites-reference/issues) or [project page](https://github.com/users/PajaritoMoyqi/projects/4) to see it.

If you want to do something for sleeping works in project page, you can make new 'Proposal' issue and link a specific post in project page.
